**Question 1:**  True or false.

The PDE 

$$T_t = kT_{xx} + g(x,t)$$

with $g(x,t)\neq 0$$ is called the **nonhomogeneous heat equation**.


**Questin 2:**  Multiple choice.

Which of the following BVP features a homogeneous boundary condition.

* (A) $$T_t = kT_{xx} + \sin(t)x,\quad T_x(0,t) = 0,\ T_x(1,t) = 4,\ T(x,0) = 0$$
* (B) $$T_t = kT_{xx} + 3,\quad T(0,t) = 1,\ T(1,t) = 0,\ T(x,0) = 0$$
* (C) $$T_t = kT_{xx} + \sin(xt),\quad T_x(0,t) = 0,\ T(1,t) = 0,\ T(x,0) = x$$
* (D) $$T_t = kT_{xx} + x\tanh(t),\quad T(0,t) = 1,\ T(1,t) = 1,\ T(x,0) = 0$$


**Question 3:**  True or false.

Any BVP for the heat equation with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions can be translated to a BVP for the nonhomogeneous heat equation with a homogeneous boundary condition.


**Question 4:**  True or false.

If $$w(x,t)$$ is a solution of the homogeneous BVP

$$w_t = kw_{xx},\quad w(0,t) = 0,\ w(2,t) = 0,\ u(x,t) = x^4\sin(\pi x),$$

then $$u(x,t) = w(x,t) + x$$

is a solution of the nonhomogeneous BVP

$$w_t = kw_{xx},\quad w(0,t) = 0,\ w(2,t) = 2,\ u(x,t) = x^4\sin(\pi x).$$
