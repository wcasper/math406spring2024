**Question 1:**

True or false.
The function $$u(x,t) = x^2e^{2t}$$ is a solution of the partial differential equation

$$u_t = x^2u_{xx}.$$


**Question 2:**

True or false.

The following PDE is linear

$$u_{x,t} = u_{xxx} + x^3u_t.$$

**Question 3:**

True or false.

The following PDE is a first-order homogeneous linear PDE

$$u_{t} = 3u_{x} + x^3.$$

**Question 3:**

Multiple choice.
Curves on which solutions of a first order linear ODE are constant are called
* (A) isopycnal curves
* (B) integral curves
* (C) homogeneous curves
* (D) characteristic curve

**Question 4:**

True or false.
Solutions $$\rho(x,t)$$ to the constant advection equation for

$$\rho_t + U\rho_x = 0$$

just take the initial value $$\rho(x,0)$$ and translate it across the $$x$$-axis at a rate of $$U$$ units of space per unit time.
