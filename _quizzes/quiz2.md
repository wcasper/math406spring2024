**Question 1:**  True or false.

If $$x$$ and $$t$$ are indepndent variables and 

$$\frac{F'(x)}{F(x)} = \frac{G'(t)}{G(t)},$$

then $$F'(x)/F(x)$$ must be a constant.

**Question 2:**  True or false.

The functions

$$u_n(x,t) = e^{-n^2\pi^2kt/L^2}\cos(n\pi x/L),\ \ n=0,1,2,3$$

are fundamental solutions to the heat equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the interval $$[0,L]$$.

**Question 3:**  Multiple choice.

A boundary value problem is called **well-posed** if
* (A) the person posing it is a "cool cat or kitten"
* (B) there is a solution
* (C) there is exactly one solution
* (D) if it has a boundary condition and an initial condition

**Question 4:** 

The **superposition principle** says that a linear combination of solutions to a homogeneous boundary value problem with the heat equation is also a solution.
