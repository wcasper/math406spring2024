**Question 1:**  True or false.

The **energy**

$$E(t) = \int_0^L u(x,t)dx$$

of a solution $$u(x,t)$$ of the heat equation with homogeneous boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, or mixed) cannot increase.

**Questin 2:**  Multiple choice.

Consider the heat equation with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions

$$u_t = ku_{xx},\ \ u_x(0,t) = a(t),\ \ u_x(L,t) = b(t),\ \  u(x,0) = f(x).$$

For this equation we should propose a solution of what form.


* (A) $$u(x,t) = v(x,t) + \frac{b(t)-a(t)}{L}x + a(t).$$
* (B) $$u(x,t) = v(x,t) + \frac{b(t)-a(t)}{2L}x^2 + a(t)x.$$
* (C) $$u(x,t) = v(x,t) + \frac{b(t)-a(t)}{2L}x^2 + a(t).$$
* (D) $$u(x,t) = v(x,t) + \frac{b(t)-a(t)}{2L}x + a(t)x.$$


**Question 3:**  True or false.

The solution of the heat equation with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions

$$u_t = ku_{xx},\ \ u_x(0,t) = 0,\ \ u_x(L,t) = 2L,\ \  u(x,0) = x^2 + \cos(\pi x/L)$$

is $$u(x,t) = 2kt+x^2 + e^{-\pi^2 kt/L^2}\cos(\pi x/L)$$.
