**Question 1:**  True or false.

The Fourier transform of $$e^{-\pi x^2}$$ is $$e^{-\pi k^2}$$.

**Question 2:**  True or false.

In order to prove that the inverse Fourier transform of $$\hat f(k)$$ is $$f(x)$$, we considered the limit as $$a\rightarrow 0$$ of the integral

$$\int_{\mathbb R} e^{-ak^2}\hat f(k)e^{2\pi i kx}dk.$$

**Question 3:**  True or false.

The function

$$\varphi\mapsto \varphi(0)^2$$

is a distribution.

**Question 4**:  True or false.

The Fourier transform of $$e^{2\pi i ax}$$ (viewed as a distribution) is $$\delta_a$$.
