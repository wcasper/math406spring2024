**Question 1:**  True or false.

To solve the heat equation with a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition and with $$T(x,0) = f(x)$$ on $$[0,L]$$, we should use the cosine series.

**Question 1:**  True or false.

Any piecewise continuous function $$f(x)$$ on $$[0,L]$$ has both a sine series expansion and a cosine series expansion.

**Question 3:**  Numerical.

Consider the boundary value problem

$$u_t = u_{xx},\ u_x(0,t) = 0,\ u_x(1,t) = 0,\ u(x,0) = \cos(2\pi x) + \cos(5\pi x).$$

Determine the value of $$u(0.5,0.1)$$ up to $$5$$ decimal places.
