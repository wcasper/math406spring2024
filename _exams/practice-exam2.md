### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  
In the actual exam, you will be allowed scratch paper and a pencil, but no calculator or note sheet.


**Problem 1:** Find the general solution of the partial differential equation

* (A) Show that if $$u(x,y)$$ is harmonic everywhere in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$ and bounded below, then $$u$$ is constant.
* (B) Show that the statement is false when we allow $$u(x,y)$$ to be unbounded.

**Problem 2:** 

Consider the quarter disk (in polar coordinates) $$\Omega = \{(r,\theta): 0 < r < R,\ \ 0 < \theta < \pi/2\}$$.
Find a solution to Laplace's equation 

$$\Delta u = 0,\ \ (r,\theta)\in \Omega$$

with the boundary conditions

$$u(r,0) = 0,\ \ 0 < r < R,\ \ u(r,\pi/2) = 0,\ \ 0 < r < R,\ \ u(R,\theta) = \sin(2\theta).$$

**Problem 3:**

* (A) If $$u(x,y) = f(x/y)$$ is a harmonic function, solve the ODE satisfied by $$f$$.
* (B) Convert your result from (A) to polar coordinates and show that $$\partial u/\partial r = 0$$.  
* (C) As a converse, suppose that $$v(x,y)$$ is any function in the upper half plane with $$\partial u/\partial r = 0$$.  Show that $$v = g(x/y)$$ for some function $$g$$.

**Problem 4:**

Find a solution of Laplace's equation $$\Delta u = 0$$ in the rectangle $$\Omega = (0,L)\times (0,M)$$
with the boundary conditions

$$u(L,y) = y(M-y),\ 0 < y < M,\ \ \ u(0,y) = 0,\ 0 < y < M,$$

$$u(x,0) = 0,\ 0 < x < L,\ \ \ u(x,M) = 0,\ 0 < x < L.$$


**Problem 5:**

Find the Green's function for the domain consisting of the first octant

$$\Omega = \{(x,y,z): x > 0,\ y > 0,\ z > 0\}.$$

**Problem 6:**

Consider the differential equation

$$u_{tt}-2u_{tx} + u_{xx}=0.$$

Following our methodology for the wave equation, find a d'Alembert style
solution to the PDE on the whole real line satisfying the initial condition

$$u(x,0) = f(x),\ \ u_t(x,0) = g(x).$$
