### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  
In the actual exam, you will be allowed scratch paper and a pencil, but no calculator or note sheet.


**Problem 1:** Find the general solution of the partial differential equation

$$xu_x + (4y-x^3+x)u_y = 0.$$

**Problem 2:** Use the method of separation of variables to find the solution of the BVP

$$u_{t} = 9tu_{xx}$$

with the boundary conditions

$$u(0,t) = 0,\ \ u(L,t) = \sin(2\pi x/L) + \sin(5\pi x/L).$$

**Problem 3:**

* (a) Determine the cosine series expansion of $$f(x) = \sin(x)$$ on $$[0,\pi]$$.
* (b) Find a solution of the BVP

$$u_t = ku_{xx},\ \ t > 0$$

with the boundary conditions

$$u_x(0,t) = 0,\ \ u_x(\pi,t) = 0,\ \ u(x,0) = \sin(x).$$

**Problem 4:**

Prove each of the following properties of the Fourier transform

* (a) if $$g(x) = f(x+x_0)$$, then $$\hat g(\xi) = e^{2\pi i\xi x_0}f(\xi)$$
* (b) if $$g(x) = f'(x)$$, then $$\hat g(\xi) = 2\pi i\xi \hat f(\xi)$$
* (c) if $$h(x) = f(x)g(x)$$, then $$\hat h(\xi) = (\hat f * \hat g)(\xi)$$
* (d) if $$\hat f(\xi) = \delta_2'(\xi)$$, then $$f(x) = -2\pi i x e^{4\pi i x}$$

**Problem 5:**

Find a solution of the following nonhomogeneous heat equation

$$u_t = 8u_{xx} + (x/\pi)\cos(t) + e^t\sin(3x),\ \ 0\leq x\leq \pi,\ t>0$$

with the nonhomogeneous boundary conditions

$$u(0,t) = \sin(t),\ \ \ u(\pi,t) = 0,\ \ \ u(x,0) = 0.$$

**Problem 6:**

* (a) Determine the value of $$\int_{\mathbb{R}} xe^{-ax^2}dx$$.  [Hint: odd]
* (b) Determine the value of $$\int_{\mathbb{R}} x^2e^{-ax^2}dx$$.  [Hint: differentiation under the integral]
* (c) Find a solution of the Cauchy problem

$$u_t = ku_{xx},\ \ u(x,0) = x^2.$$
