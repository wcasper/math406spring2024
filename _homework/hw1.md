### Directions
Solve the following problems and write up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* written on ancient parchement with a quill and then flown to the instructor via owl post like in Harry Potter

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

You will be graded based on *completion* of all of the assigned problems, along with in-depth grading of *select* problems which will not be revealed until after the homework is graded.

**Remember:** Success in any math class is based on *practice*.  The assigned homework problems are the **bare minimum**.  You should strive to do as many problems as possible from the textbook.

# Problem 

Consider the first-order linear partial differential equation

$$yu_x - xu_y = 0$$

* (a) Use the **method of characteristics** to find the general solution of this equation.
* (b) Find a solution of the equation satisfying the property that $$u(x,0) = e^{-x^2}$$ for all $$x\in\mathbb{R}$$.

# Problem

Prove the following orthogonality relations for sine and cosine.

* (a) $$\int_0^T \sin(2\pi n t/T)\cos(2\pi n t/T) = 0$$ for all $$m,n\geq 0$$
* (b) $$\int_0^T \sin(2\pi n t/T)\sin(2\pi n t/T) = (L/2)\delta_{m,n}$$ for all $$m\geq 0,\ n > 0$$
* (c) $$\int_0^T \cos(2\pi n t/T)\cos(2\pi n t/T) = (L/2)\delta_{m,n}$$ for all $$m\geq 0,\ n > 0$$

# Problem

Consider the function

$$f(x) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 0\leq x < 3\\
1 & 3\leq x \leq 6
\end{array}\right.$$

* (a) Calculate the cosine series expansion of $$f(x)$$ on the interval $$[0,6]$$.
* (b) Plot the function $$f(x)$$ versus the partial sums $$A_0 + \sum_{n=1}^N A_n\cos(n\pi x/6)$$ of the cosine series expansion of $$f(x)$$ on $$[0,6]$$ for $$N = 25, 50, 75$$, and $$N = 100$$.
* (c) What is happening in the plots of (b) at the special point $$x=3$$?

# Problem 

Find an explicit expression for the solution of the boundary value problem

$$T_t = kT_{xx},\ \ T_x(0,t) = 0,\ T_x(L,t) = 0,\ T(x,0) = x^2(L-x)^2.$$ 

What does the function $$T(x,t)$$ limit to as $$t\rightarrow\infty$$?
